# Smart_Parking_System_ATmega32
The project controls four parking slots, with each slot linked to an IR sensor and an LED. The status of each parking slot is updated based on the sensor readings. When a car is detected, the LED corresponding to the occupied slot is turned on. Once the car leaves, the LED is turned off.
